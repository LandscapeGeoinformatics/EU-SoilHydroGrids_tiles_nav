# EU-SoilHydroGrids_tiles_nav

The [The multilayered European Soil Hydraulic Database (EU-SoilHydroGrids ver1.0)](https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/3d-soil-hydraulic-database-europe-1-km-and-250-m-resolution) downloadable from the EU Joint Research Centre
European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) is a fantastic resource. It is a high resolution collection of tiled Geotiff files of various hydraulic soil parameters ( [TÃ³th et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11203)), gridded over all of Europe. However, we found it difficult to find the right tiles for our catchment area.

![Grid Tiles over OSM basemap](grid_cells_250m_europe.png)

So, we created a polygon layer (available as SHP and GPKG) in 3 main useful projections for a more easy navigation, in order to support quick identification of your desired EU-SoilHydroGrids 250m GeoTiff tile folders.

For that we used Python and the `rasterio` library to read out the extents and coordinate reference system of the rasters:

```python
import numpy as np
import os

import rasterio
from rasterio.plot import show
from rasterstats import zonal_stats
from rasterio.warp import calculate_default_transform, reproject, Resampling

# the extracted zip from the download
path = r"E:\GEODATA\soil\eu_soil_hydrogrids\EU_SoilHydroGrids_250m_2017Feb08"

grid_cells = {}

folders = []
# r=root, d=directories, f = files
for r, d, f in os.walk(path):
    for folder in d:
        folders.append(folder)

        for r1, d1, f1 in os.walk(os.path.join(path, folder)):

            for file in f1:
                # we only took the first file per folder assuming they share the same extent and coordinate reference system
                if f"FC_M_sl1_{folder}.tif" in file:
                    files.append(os.path.join(r1, file))
                    data_src = rasterio.open(os.path.join(r1, file))
                    srs = data_src.crs
                    bounds = data_src.bounds
                    sub_obj = {
                        'grid_id': folder,
                        'srs': srs,
                        'bounds': bounds
                    }
                    grid_cells.update({ folder: sub_obj})
```

And then we wrote the grid cells out into a GDAL/OGR data source with the `fiona` library:

```python
import fiona
from shapely.geometry import box, Polygon, shape, mapping
from collections import OrderedDict

schema = {
    "geometry": "Polygon",
    "properties": OrderedDict([
        ("grid_id", "str:200"),
    ])
}

def make_poly_from_bounds(bounds):
    # (minx, miny, maxx, maxy) or a Polygon instance
    bbox = box(bounds.left, bounds.bottom, bounds.right, bounds.top)
    return bbox

def make_feature_from_dict(grid_obj):
    return {
        "geometry": mapping(make_poly_from_bounds(grid_obj.get('bounds'))),
        "properties": {"grid_id": grid_obj.get('grid_id')}
    }

features = []

# we could also do this in a for comprehension
for obj in grid_cells.values():
    feat = make_feature_from_dict(obj)
    features.append(feat)

crs_wkt = data_src.crs.wkt

with fiona.open(r"E:\GEODATA\soil\eu_soil_hydrogrids\EU_SoilHydroGrids_250m_2017Feb08\grid_cells_250m_aeqd84.shp", "w", driver="ESRI Shapefile", schema=schema, crs_wkt=crs_wkt) as collection:
    collection.writerecords(features)
    print(len(collection))
    collection.flush()
```

And then reprojected and saved the polygon layers in the original European-centred aeqd/wgs84, EPSG:4326  WGS84 and European projected ETRS89 in SHP and GPG with GDAL/OGR.

```bash
    # reproject example from original European-centred aeqd/wgs84 to EPSG:4326 WGS84
    ogr2ogr -f grid_cells_250m_wgs84.shp -t_srs EPSG:4326 grid_cells_250m_aeqd84.shp
    # convert from SHP to GPKG
    ogr2ogr -f GPKG grid_cells_250m_wgs84.gpkg grid_cells_250m_wgs84.shp
    ...
```
